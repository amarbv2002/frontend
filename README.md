# My personal portfolio
Hi there! My name is Amar Karthik, and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I decided to find out how these websites are actually built. Fast forward to 2022, specializing in Front-end Web development and having an interest in Graphic design. This year's resolution is to be an UI/UX designer too. In the past 6 years, I have designed more than 50 websites and more than 200 graphic designing works as a part-time income from my freelancing career.
